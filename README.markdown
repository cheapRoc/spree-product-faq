Product FAQs for Spree
======================

Our client's store needed an area for frequently asked
questions (FAQs), so we created this extension.

This FAQ extension helps reference Question/Answers to Products. Feel free to fork and
extend as you see fit.

Installation
------------

Install the extension like any other, and place your link_to faq_path some place.

You can place it in vendor/spree/app/views/shared/_store_menu, but remember it'll
be wiped out when you update Spree.

Enjoy!
